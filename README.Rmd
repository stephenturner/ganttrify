# ganttrify

## Example

Here is an example project:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(ganttrify::test_project)
```


Month since the beginning of the project are used as reference in order to make it easier to change the date when the project starts without needing to change the timing of all activities.

If you prefer to include dates instead of month numbers, please see additional examples below.


```{r gantt_chart}
library("ganttrify")

ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          project_start_date = "2021-03",
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```
[all examples in this page will use the `Roboto condensed` font; if it is not installed, you can use the default `sans`. See the *Troubleshooting* section at the bottom of this readme.]

"But what if I wanted to add spot labels for events, deliverables, outputs, milestones, things like that?", you asked.

Just put them in a table with these column names, and you will be served.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(ganttrify::test_spots)
```

```{r gantt_charts_with_events}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots,
          project_start_date = "2021-03",
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```

"I can't read the text, can I change the text size?", I heard. 
"Also, is it possible to outline quarters?"

You're welcome. 

```{r gantt_charts_resized_text}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots,
          project_start_date = "2021-03",
          size_text_relative = 1.2, 
          mark_quarters = TRUE,
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```


It appears that some of you don't like having a line for the working package and are fine with just lines for activities. Did you mean it like this?

```{r gantt_no_wp}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          hide_wp = TRUE,
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```


I thought we all liked rounded lines and full opacity, but it's ok if you don't:
  
```{r gantt_butt_line_transparency}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          project_start_date = "2021-04",
          alpha_wp = 0.9,
          alpha_activity = 0.6,
          line_end = "butt")
```


Some of us work on very long projects, and may need to declutter the chart to increase readability. So let's show the month number only once every three months, and hide the thin vertical lines included by default.

```{r gantt_36_months}
test_36 <- ganttrify::test_project
test_36[11,4] <- 36

ganttrify(project = test_36,
          project_start_date = "2021-04", 
          month_breaks = 3,
          show_vertical_lines = FALSE)
  
```

Does right-aligned text bother you

```{r gantt_left_aligned}

ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots,
          project_start_date = "2021-04",
          axis_text_align = "left") 
```

```{r gantt_centre_aligned}

ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots,
          project_start_date = "2021-04",
          axis_text_align = "centre") 
```

Finally, keep in mind that ganttrify outputs `ggplot` objects. Some theming options may not behave exactly as you expect, but for example adding title, subtitle, and captions can be done as you would normally do with any `ggplot` graphs. 

```{r gantt_with_text}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots,
          project_start_date = "2020-01",
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")+
  ggplot2::labs(title = "My beautiful plans for 2020",
                subtitle = "I will definitely comply with the exact timing of each and all activities*",
                caption = "* I mean, I'll do my best, but if there's a pandemic or something, it's not my fault really")
```



## Shiny app

If you prefer interactive web interfaces to coding, you can still have a fancy *ganttrified* chart.

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny_ganttrify()
```

### Shiny app on Docker

Alright, you don't know like R, but you know how Docker works?

This is all you need to find yourself a nice web app on `localhost`

```
docker run -p 80:80 giocomai/ganttrify
```

You can of course build yourself the docker image using the Dockerfile included in this repo.  

## Additional input formats

Alright, you prefer to use dates rather than month numbers from the beginning of the project. You're welcome: just format the date as follows, and remember to include the `month_number_label = FALSE` parameter. You can also use exact dates (e.g. `2021-01-01`), but by default they would still be converted to include the entire month were that given day falls. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(ganttrify::test_project_date_month)
```

```{r}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project_date_month,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots_date_month,
          by_date = TRUE,
          size_text_relative = 1.2, 
          mark_quarters = TRUE,
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```

As it turns out, someone wants more detail: they'd like to be able to input activities with an exact start and end date. I start to suspect that `ganttrify` at this stage may not be exactly what you're looking for, but perhaps this works for you?

```{r}
knitr::kable(ganttrify::test_project_date_day)
```


```{r}
ganttrify(project = ganttrify::test_project_date_day,
          spots = ganttrify::test_spots_date_day,
          by_date = TRUE,
          exact_date = TRUE,
          size_text_relative = 1.2,
          month_number_label = FALSE,
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Structure of the input table

At this stage, the package has strong expectations about the input format, and does not provide meaningful error messages. If you see unexpected results, please consider that:

- no cell in the activity column must be empty
- an activity cannot be called the same as a wp
- activities in different wp should have different names (or at least add a space at the end or something so that they look different to the computer).

Some of this limitations should be dealt with in a future update.

### Fonts

By default, this package uses a generic *sans* font but it is recommended to use a narrow (or condensed font such as *[Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed)* font - a free font that can be downloaded and installed on any desktop - as they make more efficient use of text space. 

On Fedora, you can install it with `sudo dnf install google-roboto-condensed-fonts`

On Debian, you can install it with `sudo apt-get install fonts-roboto-fontface`

After installation, you should make sure the font is available to R by installing the `extrafont` package, and running `extrafont::font_import()`.

You can check available fonts also with the package `systemfonts` and the command `systemfonts::system_fonts()`.

### Dependencies

To reduce the number of dependencies, `extrafont`, as well as the packages used by the Shiny app needed to import data (`googlesheets4`, `readxl`) and to export the chart in svg (`svglite`) are only suggested. 

You can install them independently (they're all on CRAN), or together with this package with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("giocomai/ganttrify", dependencies = TRUE)
```
